We took part in the three subtasks of the evaluation: Named Entity Recognition per se, Entity Normalization and Fact Extraction. We chose a rule-based approach to the task. The three subtasks correspond to the modules of ‘Hurma’ parser, the tool we have developed. In addition to traditional lexicon and regular expressions based rules, it allows creating elaborate rules to mine and normalize different kinds of entities with regard to specific challenges such language as Russian presents to the researchers. For Fact Extraction, we used skip-gram based algorithm with no dependencies in order to overcome the problem of data sparsity. Preliminary results show that our Entity Extraction and Normalization methods score reasonably high and our Fact Extraction score is high enough, taken into account that that our expected maximum F-measure is relati",

of necessary rules and makes them laconic.
The evaluation was conducted on FactRuEval dataset. FactRuEval is an open
evaluation of IE systems. The participants could take part in three tracks.
The first track required to detect the boundaries and type of named entities
in a text. The second track required to extract normalized attributes and
perform local identification of named entities. The third track required to extract
facts of certain types from a text. We took part in all three of the tracks
with the nickname violet. Our method proved to be successful: we have
achieved high F-measures in Named Entity Recognition tracks and the
highest F-measure in Fact Extraction track.",

	while only 950 words for Ukrainian and nothing for Belorussian, Bosnian or
	Macedonian. Similarly, the Autodesk Machine Translation dataset only covers
	three Slavonic languages (Czech, Polish and Russian). In this talk I will
	discuss a general approach, which can be called Language Adaptation, similarly
	to Domain Adaptation. In this approach, a model for a particular language
	processing task is built by lexical transfer of cognate words and by learning a
	new feature representation for a lesser-resourced (recipient) language starting
	from a better-resourced (donor) language. More specifically, I will demonstrate
	how language adaptation works in such training scenarios as Translation Quality
	Estimation, Part-of-Speech tagging and Named Entity Recognition.},
